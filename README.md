Playground for libvips WASM binary for image processing

[Libvips](https://www.libvips.org/) is a C library for fast and lightweight image processing. There are various bindings for Vips like in Python, [Go](https://github.com/davidbyttow/govips) and even [WebAssembly](https://github.com/kleisauke/wasm-vips). 

This repo contains simple examples of image resizing code using Vips in [Go](https://github.com/avichalp/vips-wasm-examples/tree/main/go-vips) and in [Wasm](https://github.com/avichalp/vips-wasm-examples/tree/main/wasm-vips). And a few more examples of using [WASM with Emscripten and C](https://github.com/avichalp/vips-wasm-examples/tree/main/wasm-examples).
